StrayCare – Stray Animal Rescue System

A full-stack platform built to rescue, protect, and support stray animals by connecting citizens, volunteers, and NGOs in real time.

StrayCare is a mission-driven web application designed to streamline the rescue process for stray animals.
It enables people to instantly report animals, NGOs to manage rescue operations, and users to adopt, donate, and support animal welfare.

🌟 Why StrayCare?

Stray animals often suffer due to delayed reporting, lack of proper channels, and poor coordination between the public and rescue teams.
StrayCare solves this with a centralized digital rescue system that:

✔ Reduces response time
✔ Provides accurate location-based reporting
✔ Helps NGOs manage cases efficiently
✔ Encourages adoption and donations
